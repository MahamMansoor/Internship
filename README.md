Task 1 :      
User input handling
	•	 Typecasting using int() and float()
	•	 Formatted strings using f-strings
	•	 Basic data types (int, float, str)
	•	 type() usage for extra learning (shows data type name)

 Task 2:
 The task helps reinforce key Python foundations such as:
 Working with variables and expressions
 Taking user input
 Using arithmetic operators
 Applying string methods like .find() and slicing
 Implementing conditional logic (e.g., avoiding division by zero

 Task 3: 
Input Handling: Take a sentence from the user.
 
List Operations:
Split the sentence into a list of words using .split().
Display the list of words.

String Rebuilding:
Rejoin the list into a sentence using ' - ' as a separator via .join().
Display the new sentence.

Tuple Usage:
Store your first and last name in a tuple.
Print each part (first and last name) using indexing.

Task 4:

Tuples (Immutable Data Structures):
Learn how to store fixed student IDs using a tuple, which cannot be changed once created.

Sets (Handling Unique Items):
Practice using sets to manage a list of unique course names — allowing dynamic addition/removal without duplicates.

Code Readability (Using Comments):
Learn how to write clean and maintainable code by adding meaningful inline comments for each logic block.



Task 05 :

Learn how to define and call functions with clear input and output.
Use lists of tuples to organize grade and credit hour data.
Apply dictionaries for grade-to-GPA point conversion.
Implement weighted average logic for GPA computation.
Practice input validation and user interaction via input().
Use named parameters for flexibility and readability.
Produce clean, formatted output using print() and round().

Task 06:

Learn how to use Boolean expressions and comparison operators to check score ranges.
Create a function to convert a numeric score (0–100) into a letter grade (e.g., A, B+, F).
Validate user input to ensure scores are within the valid range.
Display a clear summary using formatted output like:
"Student Maham scored 97.5 → Grade: A-"

Task 7:

Key Learning Goals:
Practice using for, while, and nested loops
Learn how to use enumerate() to access both index and value during iteration
Perform manual computation of statistical values (sum, average, min, max)
Use sorted() function to sort a list
Avoid using built-in helpers like sum(), min(), or max() for calculations

Task 8:

Understand how to store and access nested data structures in Python using dictionaries.

Practice user input handling and validation.

Implement conditional logic to manage different operations.

Create a loop-based interactive menu for continuous usage.

Enhance your program with real-world features like name normalization and email validation.
