Task 1 :      
User input handling
	•	 Typecasting using int() and float()
	•	 Formatted strings using f-strings
	•	 Basic data types (int, float, str)
	•	 type() usage for extra learning (shows data type name)

 Task 2:
 The task helps reinforce key Python foundations such as:
 Working with variables and expressions
 Taking user input
 Using arithmetic operators
 Applying string methods like .find() and slicing
 Implementing conditional logic (e.g., avoiding division by zero

 Task 3: 
Input Handling: Take a sentence from the user.
 
List Operations:
Split the sentence into a list of words using .split().
Display the list of words.

String Rebuilding:
Rejoin the list into a sentence using ' - ' as a separator via .join().
Display the new sentence.

Tuple Usage:
Store your first and last name in a tuple.
Print each part (first and last name) using indexing.

Task 4:

Tuples (Immutable Data Structures):
Learn how to store fixed student IDs using a tuple, which cannot be changed once created.

Sets (Handling Unique Items):
Practice using sets to manage a list of unique course names — allowing dynamic addition/removal without duplicates.

Code Readability (Using Comments):
Learn how to write clean and maintainable code by adding meaningful inline comments for each logic block.
